Each algorithm in this analysis is stored in it’s own iPython notebook and is named according to the algorithm (e.g. ANN.ipynb). To run each, type “jupyter notebook <filename.ipynb>” into the terminal after navigating to the folder containing the file. From here, select the first cell of the notebook and run it with Shift+Enter. This performs GridSearchCV and output files with information on parameter selection, learning curves, computation time and final model performance into the “output” folder. The Plots.ipynb file can be opened from the terminal in the same way, although there are multiple cells to be run using Shift+Enter. This will print the plots in the notebook as well as store them in .png files in the output folder.
